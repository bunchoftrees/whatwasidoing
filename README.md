# 🧠 whatwasidoing

A tiny CLI to remind you what the hell you were doing last time you touched a project.

It prints:
- Your **last Git commit message**
- Any `TODO` or `FIXME` comments in your project files

Great for:
- Jumping back into side projects
- Picking up where you left off
- Keeping your future self from crying
